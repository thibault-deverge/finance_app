## 🚀 Overview

This project started as a [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenge to build a finance dashboard. It has since evolved into a full-stack application with user authentication (Clerk), a PostgreSQL database hosted on NeonDB, and server actions for all CRUD operations.

Users can:

- View an **Overview** dashboard with budgets, pots, and latest transactions at-a-glance
- Browse **Transactions** with pagination, search, sort, and category filters
- Manage **Budgets** and **Saving Pots** with full CRUD operations
- **Add**, **withdraw**, and track progress toward each pot
- Track **Recurring Bills** each month, search and sort them
- Upload a custom **avatar** per transaction
- Perform all actions via **keyboard** only, with proper focus and hover states
